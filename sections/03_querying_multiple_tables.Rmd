# Cross Joins

.f3[Also called .underline[cartesian product]]

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[SQL]
```{sql, connection=con, echo=T, output.var="cross_join"}
SELECT municipalities.municipality_id, governorates.governorate_id
FROM municipalities, governorates;
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Output (partial)]
```{r}
cross_join %>% head() %>% kable()
```
]
]

# Inner Joins

.f3[Inner joins are assumed by default. Using .b[JOIN] is equivalent to .b[INNER JOIN]]

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[SQL]
```{sql, connection=con, echo=T, output.var="inner_join_df"}
SELECT
  m.municipality_id,
  m.name_fr,
  g.governorate_id,
  g.name_fr
FROM
  municipalities m
INNER JOIN 
  governorates g
  ON
  m.governorate_id = g.governorate_id
WHERE
  g.governorate_id = 13;
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Output (partial)]
```{r}
inner_join_df %>% head() %>% kable()
```
]
]

---
# Left join

.f3[With a left join, we make sure we keep all records from the left most table in our query.]

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[SQL]
```{sql, connection=con, echo=T, output.var="left_join_df"}
SELECT m.name_fr, e.score
FROM   municipalities m
       LEFT JOIN evaluations e
              ON e.municipality_id = m.municipality_id
WHERE e.year = 2017; 
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Output (partial)]
```{r}
left_join_df %>% head() %>% kable()
```

]

]
---
# Self join

Self joins are useful when a table contains a hierarchical 
or a graph structure.

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[SQL]
```{sql, connection=con, echo=T, output.var="self_join"}
SELECT
    c.criterion_id
    , c.parent_id
    , pc.criterion_id AS pc_criterion_id
FROM
    criteria c
LEFT JOIN criteria pc ON
    c.parent_id = pc.criterion_id;
```
]
.panel[.panel-name[Output (partial)]
```{r}
self_join %>% head() %>% kable()
```

]

# Querying more than two tables

We wish to have a table showing a .underline[complete] list of municipalities,
their corresponding governorates, their evaluation criteria and scores for the year 2017.

--

```sql
SELECT
    m.name_fr municipality_name
    ,
    g.name_fr governorate_name
    ,
    c.name_fr criterion_name
    ,
    e.score
FROM
    municipalities m
LEFT JOIN evaluations e ON
    m.municipality_id = e.municipality_id
INNER JOIN governorates g ON
    m.governorate_id = g.governorate_id
INNER JOIN criteria c ON
    e.criterion_id = c.criterion_id
WHERE
    e."year" = 2017;
```

# Practice problems:

1. Modify the last query to include the results only for criteria that do not have a parent.
1. Using a cross join, simulate the result of an inner join between the `municipalities`
and `governorates` tables.
2. Which type of condition join should you use if you want to return only matched rows ?
3. How many tables are contained in a self-join?
